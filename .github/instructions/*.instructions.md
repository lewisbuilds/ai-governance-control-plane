# Private Code Review Collection

My private code review rules are stored in a private repo:
https://github.com/lewisbuilds/copilot-instructions-private

Primary file for reviews:
- .collections/code-review.md
- .collections/code-review.collection.yml

When helping with PR reviews or code feedback:
- Treat that file as the main checklist.
- Lead with reasoning (what’s risky or unclear) and then suggest minimal, concrete fixes.
- Prefer small, focused changes over big refactors unless explicitly requested.
